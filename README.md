# Docker Demo POC - README.db

## Overview

This README.db file provides information for setting up and running a Docker demo Proof of Concept (POC). The demo showcases the deployment of a simple application using Docker containers. The application used in this POC is a lightweight example to demonstrate the basic concepts of containerization with Docker.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed before setting up the Docker demo:

- Docker Engine: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Setup

### Docker Installation

Follow the official Docker installation guide to install Docker on your machine: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone the Docker Demo POC repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-demo-poc.git
cd docker-demo-poc
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t docker-demo-poc:latest .
```

## Running the Demo

To run the Docker demo, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker-demo-poc:latest
```

This command starts a containerized instance of the application and maps port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

## Application Access

Access the demo application by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.

## Cleanup

To stop and remove the Docker container, use the following commands:

```bash
docker stop <container-id>
docker rm <container-id>
```

Replace `<container-id>` with the actual container ID or name.
